                Hi!
                My name is Jorge and I am an emerging professional currently studying software development & Quality Assurance. I previously was working in a blue collar job and decided it was time for a career change!
                I am currently doing a program called Year Up to enhance my professional skills as well as my technical skills, That will help in my internship and future career!
                Born in Los Angeles, CA but raised in Seattle, WA, I plan to stay here and build something here.
                Things I enjoy are Video games and watching Football. I Also enjoy walks on the beach!</p></td>
